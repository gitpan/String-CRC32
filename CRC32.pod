=head1 NAME

CRC32 - Perl interface cyclic redundency check generation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use String::CRC32;
    
    $crc = crc32("some string");
    $crc = crc32("some string", initvalue);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<CRC32> module calculates CRC of 32 bit lenghts. 
It generates the same CRC values as ZMODEM, PKZIP, PICCHECK and
many others.

=head1 EXAMPLE

    $crc = crc32("some string");

  results in the same as

    $crc = crc32(" string", crc32("some"));

This is useful for subsequent CRC checking of substrings.

CRC algorithm code taken from CRC-32 by Craig Bruce. 
The module stuff is inspired by a similar perl module called 
String::CRC by David Sharnoff & Matthew Dillon.
Horst Fickenscher told me that it could be useful to supply an init
value to the crc checking function and so I included this possibility.
